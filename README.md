# Overview

Here, we analyse how various factors such as seed pappus dimensions affect the drop times and terminal velocity of seeds in the thistle Carduus nutans. In addition, we also investigate the possible effects of experimental treatments such as mowing and warming, with the end goal of better understanding dispersal and the factors that can influence it.
