# Overview

Here, we analyse how various factors such as seed pappus dimensions affect the drop times and terminal velocity of seeds in the invasive thistle *Carduus nutans*. In addition, we also investigate the possible effects of experimental treatments such as mowing and warming, with the end goal of better understanding dispersal and the factors that can influence it.
